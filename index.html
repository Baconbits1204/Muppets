<h2>bio</h2>
<p> the Muppets are a group of monsters and animals. Though widely regarded as the greatest 
    performers of all time, an environment of internal conflict, Animals drug problem, and the 
    corrupting effects of fame eventually created a rift between the band. They unfortunately 
    continue to refuse working together ever again. </p>
